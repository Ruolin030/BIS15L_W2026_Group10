# **Overview:** This dataset contains information related to COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers in Ayawaso West District, Ghana.&#x20;

To ensure the protection of participants' privacy, several steps were undertaken to de-identify the data. Firstly, we ensured that the data does not contain any information that could directly reveal the identity of the participants such as names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.

Additionally, the data was modified by limiting the number of indirect identifiers to three and aggregating age to age range.  By so doing, the risk of re-identification was significantly reduced. Furthermore, institutional affiliation and occupation of participants could potentially lead to re-identification if combined and were thus eliminated.

Importantly, participants were informed during the consent process that data from the study would be released into a public repository. This allowed participants to make informed decisions about their participation in the study, understanding the potential implications of their de-identified data being shared publicly. A copy of the blank consent form is attached. Researchers can still utilize the de-identified data to replicate findings, validate research outcomes, and conduct further analysis

A copy of the blank questionnaire used is available as Supplemental Information on Zenodo.
