## Description of the data and file structure

Dataset1.csv

Cancer mortality risk (CMR) was calculated for each species as the proportion of cancer-related deaths among the total number of records, based on post-mortem pathological records (n = 11,840, Vincze et al., 2022). This information was sourced from Species360 and The Zoological Information Management System. The dataset initially included 191 species, but Dasyuroides byrnei was removed because of its extremely high CMR, which was considered an outlier. This CMR data were gathered from mammals in zoos worldwide, providing high-resolution cause-of-death data. CMR was estimated from neoplastic samples that substantially contributed to the animal death, as confirmed by necropsies. The CMR estimated for every species included in this dataset is based on more than 20 necropsies per species (mean = 62).

Dataset2.csv

Prevalence of neoplasia was estimated as the prevalence of any neoplasm in mammalian species from San Diegos zoos (Boddy et al., 2020). The dataset initially included 37 species, but Loxodonta africana was removed because of incongruences with other publications reporting lower cancer rates. The prevalence of neoplasia estimated for the species included in this dataset is based on an average of 23 necropsies per species. Vulpes zerda, Puma concolor, Canis mesomelas, Lama glama, Lycaon pictus, Tarsius syrichta, Macropus rufus, and Equus asinus are the only species with less than 10 necropsies analyzed.

\
We used a recently curated and standardized dataset of malignancy prevalence across mammalian species that is based on more than 20 necropsies per species (Compton et al., 2025). This resource includes additional species not considered in the other datasets. In this analysis, a list of archetypal species with very high or very low malignancy prevalence was constructed: All species were ranked according to their malignancy prevalence, and three subsets were defined using different cutoffs: rank10, rank15, and rank20, each including the 10, 15, or 20 species with the highest and lowest malignancy prevalence, respectively. These ranked groups consisting of 20, 30 and 40 species, respectively, were then used for downstream comparative analyses. The total dataset comprised 102 mammalian species.

Dataset4.csv

This is an accesory dataset, that is a summary of the main content of Dataset 1. This dataset (dataset 4) was employed to perform an order level analysis, mean CMR for all the species belonging to each order with at least 15 species (Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Primates, and Rodentia) was calculated.

Statistical analysis code for correlations between cancer prevalence and mortality risk with different phenotypic traits

Correlations of CMR and neoplasia with the different traits were performed using phylGLMMs using phyr in R Statistical and Programming Environment, version 4.2.3. Previous investigations with the species included in these datasets showed that there is a phylogenetic signal for CMR and neoplasia among mammal species (Vincze et al. 2022). To control for phylogenetic relatedness among species, we performed phylGLMMs using the original robust phylogeny by Vincze et al. (2022) (consensus_phylogeny.tre). phylGLMMs used a binomial error distribution and a logit link function, adding a random variable at the level of observations to avoid overdispersion problems. This random variable, called “species,” was constructed with the identity of each species analyzed. Not all analyses using CMR data were performed with the full set of species, since the information for some of the traits analyzed was not available for all species. All modelsperformed were evaluated for overdispersion and zero inflation using DHARMa package. All model tests showed P > 0.05, which indicates that no fit problems were detected, and therefore, unlike previous investigations, we chose to perform the analyses using species with both zero and nonzero CMR.

**Models used:**

**For Dataset1.csv**

1\) An additive phylGLMM was performed with CMR as response variable and log transformed continuous variables of covariate traits body mass, litter size, life expectancy, and gestation length. Log- transformed variables were used as fixed effects, as well as species as a random variable at the observation level ( n = 190). The physiological trait metabolic rate was also log transformed and analyzed in a separate model to avoid collinearity problems with log body mass (n = 52).

2\) A simple model for dichotomous variable litters was performed (n = 190) to test for CMR differences in monotocous or polytocous species. This dichotomous variable was tested in a model with continuous variables log life expectancy and log body mass to evaluate interaction ( n = 190).

3\) For lifestyle dichotomous variables group living, breeding system, and paternal care, we performed separate analyses to avoid collinearity problems, in all cases with CMR as the response variable, as well as species as a random variable at the level of observations. For group living and breeding system variables, we also performed models with the continuous variables (log body mass, log litter size, and log life expectancy) and tested the interaction with log body mass ( n = 146).

4\) Animal diet as a dichotomous variable was analyzed using CMR as the response variable, as well as species as a random variable at the level of observations. The association between animal diet and CMR was also assessed in relation to the other life history and lifestyle traits using four different models that include species of animal diet and group living (gregarious/solitary) and breeding system (singular/plural).

**For the Dataset2.csv**

Neoplasia data on 36 species from the second dataset were analyzed using the same phylGLMM simple models with one variable per model as before but with a different phylogeny of the 36 mammal species constructed from the updated mammalian supertree (tree_for_database2). The same data for the different morphophysiological, life history, and lifestyle traits as before were used, with the exception of log body mass and log maximum lifespan where the analyses were performed with adult mass (in kilograms) and maximum lifespan (in days) from Boddy et al. (2020).

**For Dataset4.csv**

To perform an order level analysis, mean CMR for all the species belonging to each order with at least 15 species (i.e., Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Primates, and Rodentia) was calculated. We also built indexes for each trait of interest: (i) litter index, ratio between monotocous and polytocous species within each order; (ii) group living index, ratio between the species with and without group living within each order; and (iii) breeding system index, ratio between plural and singular breeding species within eachorder. The analysis was performed with GLMs using a binomial error distribution and a logit link function, using the glmmTMB package. The total set of P values derived from analysis using CMR data was corrected for multiple testing using FDR correction.

The total set of P values derived from analysis using each dataset was corrected for multiple testing using FDR correction.
